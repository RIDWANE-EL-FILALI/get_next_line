# 🐱‍👤INFO ABOUT THE PROJECT
```
You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS and how they are interpreted by a programming
language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based on manipulating files
for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
